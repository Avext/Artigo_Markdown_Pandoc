 [Paragraphs of the original article]
  
Exact statistics on emancipados are not available, but fragmentary information does exist. In 1865, after years of British insistence that information on free Africans be collected, the Brazilian government searched its archives and came up with statistics on 8,673 persons (see Tables I and II). Of these, 1,684 were recorded as dead, 1,890 were known to have received their secondary and final letters of emancipation, and 5,099 were thought to be still in bondage. Of the latter group, however, only 2,565 could be accounted for at that date, and the fate of the remaining 2,534 was unknown. Referring to the latter group, the British Consul at Rio wrote to the Foreign Office in 1865: "The remainder it is suggested have been stolen, have died and no return has been made of their deaths, and some few may have received certificates of emancipation."

Many, of course, were excluded from the record. An unknown number freed in northern provinces were missing from the list, including all those freed during the last years of the illegal slave trade in Pernambuco and in other northern provinces. Missing were 142 Africans landed in the northern province of Maranhão in 1826 from the schooner Carolina and there partially absorbed into the slave population. Completely forgotten were 518 Africans of a cargo of 1,000 seized after landing at Santos in i851, 18i captured at Serinhaem in Pernambuco in 1856, and another 313 brought to Brazil on the yacht Mary E. Smith in 1856.Most emancipados leased to private persons were employed, like most slaves in Brazil, in agriculture or domestic service. In cities, however, they were sometimes used as pretos de ganho, hiring themselves to the public and giving a set amount to their masters. Many women were rented as wet nurses, their own children reportedly being either left to foundling homes or illegally baptized as slaves.12 Africans kept under the direct control of the government were used mainly in urban occupations. In 1821 freedmen from the schooner Emília (see Table I) were assigned to the illumination of Rio's streets, to the police station, and to the water works, and three married couples were singled out for the upkeep of the Passeio Público, a fashionable square. Thirty years later (in 1851) freedmen could be found serving in the Misericordia Hospital, in powder and iron factories, in leper houses, in the Colegio Pedro II, the National Museum and other public places. Some worked in convents of the various religious orders, and others continued to light the city streets.
